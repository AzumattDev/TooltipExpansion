| 1.1.0     | - Fix some things with jitter even after scrolling was added when used with other mods. Overall improve the mod to work a bit better. Rename some variables in the code for clarity. |
| 1.0.1     | - Tweak the readme to exclude a blerp about servers. My own Live Templates get me sometimes.                                                                                         |
