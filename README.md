# Description

## Client only mod that adds a scrolling functionality to inventory tooltips. For use when you like your UI huge, your items overpowered and/or your tooltips long.

Will not generate a configuration file, as there is no need for one. The mod is designed to be plug and play.

Appears to be compatible with Jewelcrafting and Epic Loot, but I can't guarantee it will work with every mod that changes the tooltips for inventory items.
